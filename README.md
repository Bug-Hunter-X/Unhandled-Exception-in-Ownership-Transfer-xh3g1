This repository contains a Solidity smart contract with an unhandled exception in the ownership transfer function. The `transferOwnership` function calls `_transferOwnership`, but doesn't handle potential issues that could arise within `_transferOwnership`, such as a revert. This lack of error handling can lead to unexpected behavior and leave the contract in an inconsistent state. The solution demonstrates the improved version of the code that solves this issue using try-catch statements.
